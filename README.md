# Project Steps

## 1. Project Request

Do you have a project, idea, or challenge in mind? Fill out a detailed form with all the information about your needs. Within 48 business hours, I will confirm if your project is accepted based on availability, characteristics, and project complexity.

**Initial Review:** I will analyze the requirements and determine if the project aligns with my services and current capacity.

## 2. Alignment Meeting

Schedule a time in my availability calendar. The first meeting is crucial for understanding your project's scope and clarifying expectations. If the available calendar doesn't suit your schedule, you can request a custom meeting time for an additional fee of $100 USD per 60 minutes. This service must be booked at least 48 hours in advance.

**Purpose:** We'll understand the details together, resolve doubts, and establish a solid foundation before moving forward.

## 3. Proposal and Approval

After reviewing the project, I will send you a detailed proposal including:

-   Estimated costs
-   Milestone schedule and deliverables
-   Identification of potential complexities

**Approval:** Upon acceptance of the proposal, a 50% advance payment will be required for each milestone. This ensures work initiation and progressive delivery planning.

## 4. Implementation

**Project Execution:** Development will begin according to the established plan, ensuring quality in each delivery.

**Continuous Communication:** Although work is autonomous, we'll maintain open communication channels for any inquiries via Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, or email according to your preference.

**Progress Updates:** You'll receive notifications at each important milestone to track progress without concerns.

## 5. Deployment and Final Delivery

**Project Deployment:** Upon completion, I will deploy the model or solution in the agreed environment.

**Complete Delivery:** I will send all project assets (code, documents, results, etc.), ensuring you have all necessary elements to continue or maintain the system.

**Final Payment and Feedback:** Once you confirm your satisfaction with the results, the remaining payment will be completed. Your review is welcome to help me improve.
