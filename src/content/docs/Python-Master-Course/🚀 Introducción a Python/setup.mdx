## Python Installation

Before diving into Python coding, it's essential to set up a proper development environment. This section guides you through the necessary steps, including installing Python, managing packages, and configuring your preferred tools.

The first step is to install Python on your machine. The installation process varies slightly depending on your operating system.

### Installation on Windows

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to the [Official Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for Windows.</li>
    <li>Run the installer. **Make sure to check the "Add Python to PATH" option** during the installation. This allows you to run Python from the command line.</li>
    <li>Complete the installation.</li>
    <li>To verify the installation, open the Command Prompt and type `python --version`. You should see the installed Python version printed on the console.</li>
    </ol>
</Steps>

### Installation on macOS

<Steps>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to the [Official Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for macOS.</li>
        <li>Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.</li>
        <li>Verify your installation. Open Terminal and type `python3 --version`. If you have Python 2.7 installed by default, using `python` command might give you Python 2.</li>
    </ol>
</Steps>

### Installation on Linux

Linux systems may have Python pre-installed, but it's often an older version. It's recommended to install the latest version using your distribution's package manager. Here are examples:

        <Steps>
             <ol>
                 <li>Open a Terminal.</li>
                 <li>Update the package list using `sudo apt update`.</li>
                 <li>Install Python 3 using `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`.</li>
                 <li>Verify the installation with `python3 --version` and `pip3 --version`.</li>
             </ol>
        </Steps>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Fedora/CentOS" icon="terminal">
        <Steps>
            <ol>
                <li>Open a Terminal.</li>
                <li>Update the package list using `sudo dnf update`.</li>
                <li>Install Python 3 using `sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip`.</li>
                <li>Verify the installation with `python3 --version` and `pip3 --version`.</li>
           </ol>
        </Steps>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Arch Linux" icon="terminal">
       <Steps>
           <ol>
                <li>Open a Terminal.</li>
                <li>Install Python 3 using `sudo pacman -S python python-pip`.</li>
                <li>Verify the installation with `python --version` and `pip --version`.</li>
            </ol>
       </Steps>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="tip" title="Pro Tip ‚ú®">
   If you are on Linux or Mac and want to try specific Python versions I recommend you use tools such as `pyenv`
  or `asdf` which will help you to isolate your projects.
</Aside>
## Package Managers (pip)

Python has a powerful package manager called `pip`.  It's used to install and manage external libraries and dependencies needed for your projects.

### Installing packages with pip

To install a package, use the `pip install` command followed by the package name. For example, to install the `requests` library:

```bash
pip install requests
```

To verify the installation, you can list the installed packages with:

```bash
pip list
```

### Virtual Environments

When working on multiple Python projects, each project might require different versions of packages. Using virtual environments isolates the dependencies of each project, preventing conflicts and dependency issues.

#### Creating a Virtual Environment
    
<Steps>
   <ol>
     <li>Open Terminal or Command Prompt and navigate to your project's root folder.</li>
     <li>Run the command `python3 -m venv venv`.  This creates a directory named `venv` (you can choose a different name if you wish) that contains the isolated python environment.</li>
    </ol>
</Steps>
Activate the environment:
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Linux/macOS" icon="terminal">
    <p>Use the command `source venv/bin/activate` in the terminal.</p>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Windows" icon="terminal">
        <p>Use the command `.\venv\Scripts\activate` in the Command Prompt.</p>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
<p>
You should now see the environment name `(venv)` shown on the terminal line. Any packages you install with `pip` will now be specific to this virtual environment.
4. To deactivate, use the `deactivate` command in the terminal.
</p>
## IDEs and Editors

Choosing the right development environment can significantly improve your productivity. Here are some of the most popular IDEs and editors for Python development:

### VS Code

<Steps>
  <ol>
        <li> [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your operating system.</li>
        <li> Install the Python extension by Microsoft to have support for linting, debugging, and code formatting.</li>
        <li> Install additional extensions to improve your workflow and add extra funcionality as needed.</li>
    </ol>
</Steps>

VS Code is a free, lightweight, and customizable code editor with a wide range of extensions. It is a great all-around option.

### PyCharm

<Steps>
   <ol>
       <li>[Download PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) for your operating system.</li>
       <li>Install the editor. Choose either the Professional or Community version. The community edition is free but will lack some advanced features.</li>
        <li>Configure the Python interpreter to use the one you have installed.</li>
   </ol>
</Steps>

PyCharm is a powerful and specialized IDE designed for Python development. It offers intelligent code completion, debugging tools, and support for web frameworks.

### Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab

<Steps>
   <ol>
        <li>Install Jupyter with `pip install jupyterlab`.</li>
        <li>Start Jupyter Lab with the command `jupyter lab` in the terminal. This will open a browser window.</li>
        <li>Start creating your notebooks.</li>
    </ol>
</Steps>

Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab are excellent for data analysis, visualization, and interactive development. It also allows to write and render markdown documents.

### Other Editors

Other options include Sublime Text, Atom, and Vim. Choose the one that fits your workflow and preferences the best.

<Aside type="tip" title="Tip ‚ú®">
  Start with one editor and stick to it until you feel comfortable enough to explore others. The right editor will improve your productivity and your overall coding experience.

## Basic Git for Development

Git is a version control system that helps track changes in your code and collaborate with others. It is a very important tool that you should learn to use.

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>
    Download and install Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
    </li>
        <li>
        Configure git using the following commands in the terminal. These commands only need to be set once for each machine:
             <Code code={`
            git config --global user.name "Your Name"
            git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
            `} lang="bash" title="Git Configuration" />
        </li>
        <li>
        Initialize a new git repository within your project's directory:
          ```bash
          git init
          ```
        </li>
        <li>
        Add your files to staging using:
          ```bash
          git add .
          ```
        </li>
        <li>
        Commit your changes using:
            ```bash
              git commit -m "Initial commit"
            ```
        </li>
          <li>
          (Optional) Create an account in Github or a similar git platform and create a new repository. Copy the git repository link and add it to your repository with:
          ```bash
             git remote add origin your_repository_link
          ```
          </li>
        <li>
        Finally, push your repository to your remote repository:
            ```bash
             git push -u origin main
            ```
        </li>
      </ol>
</Steps>

It's crucial to commit your changes regularly, use descriptive commit messages, and utilize branching for feature development.
