  <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

        <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>

        <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>
        <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
        <li>I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
        {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 &&
            <li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
        }
        </ul>
        <p>My skills are:</p>
        <ul>
        {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
        </ul>
        {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

        {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

        {goal === 6 ? <p>My goal is to finish in 6 days.</p> : <p>My goal is not 6 days.</p>}
